# Automated-Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System

•	The proposed attendance management system automates the process of recording the audience in an efficient and organized manner using face recognition. The calculation process follows to record the attendance and keep it in the system. 

•	The proposed system can be used during exam times or in other teaching activities where presence is very important. This system eliminates alumni identification in traditional ways such as pronouncing student names or checking student ID cards, which will not only disrupt the ongoing teaching process but also put pressure on students during the exam.

•	The system involves mainly four steps:  Face Detection, Dataset Generation, Face Recognition, and Attendance Update. 

•	The trained CNN model gives 97.7% accuracy.

•	Its fundamental goal is to eliminate time consumption and the need to maintain paperwork. 

•	Bringing this idea to the real world helps the common man to effectively and efficiently record attendance and this system helps the whole organization to evolve and achieve what is necessary by eliminating the monotonous and repetitive tasks.
